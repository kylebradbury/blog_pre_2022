<blockquote><p>Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. <em>David McCullough</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early in my career, I was told that writing was the single most important action I could take for clear thinking, creativity, and productivity. At the time, I promptly ignored that excellent advice and wrote when I had a deadline to meet and rarely more. If there's anything I've learned over my career thus far is how vitally important the act of writing is for clear and coherent thinking and for developing new ideas.</p>
<p>I'm writing this blog, then, for two purposes:primarily to share some musings on machine learning, energy, and other teaching and research concepts that I hope may be of interest to others, perhaps even to you; secondarily in so doing I organize my own thoughts and share regarding topics that I may not otherwise publish on.
I'll also share a few guiding quotes that I return to when I'm in need of inspiration in research or teaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. <em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
<p>Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. <em>Carl Sagan</em></p>
<p>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. <em>Marie Curie</em></p>
